                <p>Iâ€™m an aspiring software engineer currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at UCLA.</p>
                <p>
                    Outside of computer science, I enjoy and am improving my skills in digital 2D/3D art/animation, music performance and production, 
                    and writing good stories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I like to learn and make new things. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in working on a project together.
