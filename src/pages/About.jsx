          Hi. I go by pegifenu or polyethylene glycol on the Internet, but you
          can call me Peg or Glycol. Iâ€™m an aspiring software engineer currently
          pursuing a degree in computer science.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of computer science, I enjoy and am improving my skills in
          mathematics, digital 2D/3D art/animation, music performance and
          production, and reading/writing good stories.
        </p>
        <p>
          Feel free to contact me if you are interested in working on a project
          together.
