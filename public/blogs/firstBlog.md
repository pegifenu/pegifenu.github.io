I finally got the blog working on my website!!

Hopefully the way I did it wasn't too hacky (quyrki... myrki...). I prob should've made a separate website using a template for a blog but oh well.

The posts are written in **Markdown** and converted to React components. Here's a demo.

```python
print("Wowzers! A code block!")
```

# Astronomical title

## Big title

### Medium title

#### Small title

##### Atomic title

Anyways, website's still a huge work in progress. You'll see new features and content soon.
